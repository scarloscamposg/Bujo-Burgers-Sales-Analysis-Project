# Bujo Burgers Sales Analysis Project
Subject: Sales Analysis for Hospitality Company (Bujo Burgers)
## Project Background
Bujo Burgers is a small local fast casual food Restaurant service company, stablished in 2018 in Sandymount, following that the Terenure branch was opened in later years, with a small menu where the main products are beef and chicken burgers, who are oriented to quality and fast service, while caring about the environment and people.
In the last three years, the company have been going through an expansion phase, where they have been building a net sales registry database that has previously underutilized. This project thoroughly analyses and synthesizes this data in order to reveal insights that could improve Bujo’s success.
Insights and recommendations are provided in key areas:
•	Sales trend Analysis: An evaluation of historical net sales patterns, by branch and payment channel, detailing it by day of week, month and year.
•	Branch sales performance and comparison: An assessment of the sales number by branch and understanding of the impact on the sales over time.
## Executive Summary:
Using tools like Excel, Power query and Power BI, I pulled data from the Sales Registry database to create a Business Development Dashboard Report, to track and analyze sales over time in the last 3 years through storytelling techniques in both of their Restaurant Branches. I Recommended some Marketing strategies, that should be applied to certain days of the week to increase sales and also, I built a Digital marketing plan based on this data and other factors.
## Business Problem
Sales after Covid has decreased due to the cost-of-living crisis and other economic issues during this time, besides cost have increased. Additionally one of the branches was underperforming and it was not clear by how much. Therefore, now they needed to organize and review how sales have behaved during this time and what strategies we could apply to increase sales, and to consecutively cross it with our loyal customer data in the future.  
## Methodology
First a exploratory analysis was made to find insights of the sales by days of the week, months, and year also divided by payment channel in order to analyze online and in site sales by branch. After that two Dashboards in Power BI was built, to show the performance of net sales overtime and periods, then compare it between branches using storytelling for a more comprehensive display of the sales performance and insights to the stakeholders. 
The Dashboard Document can be seen here <https://github.com/scarloscamposg/Bujo-Burgers-Sales-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Bujo%20Sales%20Sandymount%20and%20Terenure.pbix>.

## Recommendations

•	For July and August Low Sales in Terenure:  Apply a promotion these months to uplift sales these months especially in august in Terenure. Idea Example: “TereBujo” month in Terenure. Besides It is advisable to apply a special promotion this day to increase sales in death hours or days of the week like Tuesdays.

•	For Sales of Deliveroo sometimes even reaches to credit card sales which are made on store in Terenure:  Consider strategies for loyal Deliveroo costumers too as there must be many in the app. Not only for Terenure also for Sandymount too. 

•	Reach out to the best costumers through the app Loyalty program data to be awarded with discounts and benefits.

•	Apply a Digital marketing campaign for new products and promotions targeted to different costumer segments. Refer to Digital Marketing Proposal: <https://github.com/scarloscamposg/Bujo-Burgers-Sales-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Bujo%20marketing%20plan.pdf>

•	Have a closer relationship in the Terenure Community to connect and increase sales there as it happens in the Sandymount branch which had formed a relationship with the community
